            "description": "Alas the City Farmer's Markets are bustling with local Farmer's fresh produce!! When they First opened this Spring it was more food trucks and tents from nearby restaurants selling quick grab and go lunches or treats. Which in of itself is fine except when you really look forward to what the name implies - a Farmer's Market! (Hence the 4 of 5 star rating) There's really nothing better than supporting the local Farmer's and bringing home farm to table produce knowing they are all pesticide free and the money goes right back to them growing beautiful produce Season after Season!! \n\nJust take the grocery shopping off your errands since they are open from May to October because just about anything you could ever want is found here in beautiful abundance and much less costly then the stores plus you actually get to meet the dedicated Farmer's and their families. So darn cute!\n\nOf course everything is seasonal and so what you find may varry but on my most recent visit, I brought home a basket of blueberries, another of cherries and some strawberries, juicy peaches, kale, sweet corn, vine ripe tomatoes, fresh basil and mint, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, sweet onions, raw apiary honey and a fresh bouquet of flowers all for under $40!!\n\nTip: Go a little early and scout out the Perfectly Imperfect boxes... these treasures are slightly blemished but otherwise perfect and a generous box will only run you $5.",

            "description": "I enjoy going to the farmer's market on Thursday's. The same vendors are there every week and I enjoy the atmosphere. The prices, in my opinion, are slightly higher compared to a grocery store but you get to buy from local farms. My favorite places are the Amish bakeries (they have donuts, bread, pies, etc) and the mushroom farm (vegan tamales, ravioli, veggie burgers). \n\nBeware! \nI bought a head of broccoli at one of the vendors and there were small, green caterpillars. I didn't notice them until I went home. There are ways to get ride of them but I stopped buying broccoli out of fear of finding those little critters. Just make sure to check your vegetables before buying.\n\nAll in all, it's just a great place to browse and experience. I believe it ends at the end of October, so don't miss out!",

Tons of foot traffic weaving underneath the Chicago Picasso from businesses men/women, tourists, students, and seniors all looking for the same thing: to eat and buy good ingredients. Dozens of little stalls showcasing aromatic baked goods, fresh home-grown vegetables, beekeepers from Indiana, bamboo tabletop decorations, fragrant floral pieces, even fig trees - a culturally abuzz square framed by the tall skyscrapers and under the shadow of Picasso. Yes, even if you aren't coming to buy anything, then come for the vivid colors and rush of life you'll experience here (can you tell, these kinds of things inspire me?)\n\nA huge shoutout to my friends at Kress Apiary for keeping the bees alive, please do buy their unfiltered, raw, honey (which keeps bits of honeycomb, antioxidants, and nutrients that other honey companies filter out)",

It's fun to escape the office and walk around to sample the different foods (I always snag a taste of the tofu samples).\n\nAs with a lot of the farmers market, it's pretty much the same vendors that are at all the other farmers markets around the city. But, as it gets later in the season, there's a lot more produce at a bit more reasonable prices.\n\nThere's also lots of bakery vendors, some restaurant stands (where you can get lunch food like sandwiches or pad Thai), and flower/plant stands.",

            "description": "I recently moved to River West, and this Thursday market is the one closest to me. It's not as crowded as a lot of other markets, so you can get the personal attention they lack. One of the vendors here actually took the time to explain the difference between a leek and a large green onion. (Leeks are milder and better for saut\u00e9ing and don't get as slimy.)  \n\nMy favorite bakery booth is the Amish one. I'm not sure if these women are really Amish, or if they're just actors dressed up to look Amish (hey... I've seen Witness). But I'm leaning toward authentic because they don't pluck their eyebrows. The Amish purple wheat bread with nuts is delish. But if you don't buy it before lunchtime, they usually run out. \n\nThe best produce is in the booth in the photo below. They have the best quality tomatoes, leeks and even golden beats... even my Whole Foods didn't have golden beets this summer.\n\nMy Yelp app found a Starbucks a half block away on Washington. So last week we bought a couple of lattes and sat at one of the tables in Daley Plaza. I had a yummy pan au chocolate (from the booth on the southwest corner of the plaza), and my friend had an incredible grilled cheese sandwich from Gayle's.\n\nI love this market!",

You'll pay more at Whole Foods for practically everything at the market. \n\nThe vendors are nice and everything is fresh.  \n\nThere is something for everyone.

            "description": "This is the best farmers market in Chicago for several reasons:\n\n1. It offers the cheapest produce in the city - tomatoes for $2/lb instead of $4 or even $5 in the neighborhood markets (There's a specific vendor from the Indianapolis area that has the best tomato selection around), inexpensive flowers, great selection of produce throughout the season at very reasonable prices. \n\n2. It's conveniently located steps away from the Washington blue line stop. \n\n3. There are places to sit. \n\n4. It begins before 9 a.m., unlike certain neighborhood markets (I'm looking at you, Logan Square...what kinda start time is 10 a.m.?!)\n\n5. It's downtown, close to Michigan Ave and State Street shopping. \n\nENJOY! Go get some tomatoes from the Indianapolis fellas!",

It's more of a collection of specialty items that, while intriguing and somewhat unique, don't really rep a FM, apart from logistics.\n\nIf you're looking for tons of fresh fruits, veggies and produce, well, you might want to look elsewhere. These are the items i look for when going to a place like this.\n\nAs a side, when going to the (WI) Brunkow Cheese booth, I inquired about their awesome product in a few of Chicago's notable restaurants to which they responded in utter confusion with a side of attitude.lol.   Hey Brunkow, if you're being featured in restaurants by your namesake, you might want to have the ppl representing your product/company have a basic understanding of where you are being served.

            "description": "I made a mistake in ordering a shrimp sandwich from Amazing Shrimp the other day. I've never thought of Hammond, IN as shrimp experts, or shrimp anything, but I figured, maybe they're transplants from a place where they do know shrimp. Anyways, all I can say is UGH! Nothing is much worse than feeling gross for the remainder of the day. The guy behind the tent thankfully dropped the garlic salt housed in a glass container, right before my order, or I would have been treated to a salt bath with what was termed a shrimp sandwich. The sammy was all about a huge brioche roll. After that fluffy/puffy 2 inch high, 3 inches wide piece of shiny bread, I couldn't tell you much about the shrimp, as I couldn't taste it and only saw 1 chopped up and swimming in a mayo and cabbage sea. There was seriously A LOT of mayo - i tons of dripping mayo and messy cabbage hanging over the bread. It was more like a slaw sandwich with a medium sized shrimp as an afterthought. For $13.00, that was about the biggest rip off the market has to offer.  \n\nNow, Brunkow Cheese of WI is the antithesis of the shrimp sammy. Everything from the aroma to the taste to the price was so perfect. Absolutely wonderful cheese!!!! 5 stars for the Brunkow family of cheese. \n\nA few weeks ago, the best asparagus for a buck a bunch were here. They were thin and green and delicious - so good, they were tasty raw. Not to forget, a huge bargain!!  \n\nPrices for cherries are high - or higher than Organic cherries delivered to my door...so I thought that was a bit odd for non-organics to be higher than organic. They looked tasty for the cherry devotees like me. \n\nThere's a guy that makes AMAZING cakes and has samples out to tempt customers even further. If there were more than 2 of us to devour a cake I would buy one in a heartbeat. Every flavor I've tried is decadent, flavorful, delicious and so moist.",

The prices are equal to or less than what you would pay in a restaurant and you can be assured of organic, non-gmo fare. I love Gayle's cheese sandwiches but they also have the longest line. However, just down from Gayle's is a tamale shop on the southwest corner that serves organic vegan tamales 2 for $5 that are to die for! This particular market seems to lean more towards prepared foods for consumption probably because there is such a huge supply of rabid lunch fanatics. However there is an ample selection of organic vegetables, meat, fruits, and normal farmers market-type items for sale.\n\nThis market runs from mid-May to the end of October and is famous as the longest running farmers market in Chicago. The hours from 7 AM to 3 but many of the stalls stay open later so you can stop and pick something up for the ride home if you're lucky.",

Doubly so on that last one considering you're in downtown Chicago.\n\nI go there once a week while we're lucky enough to have it for a week's worth of veggies, pastries, and toffee (OK, i load up on all sorts of other treats too).\n\nBased on the produce alone, i would give it a $, but considering all the sweets and treats and candles and flowers and whatever else you're unlikely to walk away with without buying, i rate it as a $$ overall cost factor.\n\nIn relation to the Logan Sq or various other farmer's markets I've run into, this one is the best for produce. The one by Damen between Irving and Montrose has a better cheese selection though.\n\nIn response to a couple of other reviews, some vendors DO accept credit cards, but it's not a uniform policy. I don't particularly mind since i take cash out before going there and i can certainly understand the micro-economics involved.\n\nLove it. Will take advantage of it while it's around.\nYou probably should too.",

The Daley Plaza has this lovely fountain, and seeing all the tents set up around it will give any foodie a thrill.  Who doesn't want to spend a lunch break here?\n\nThis market has several vegetable stands offering a variety of seasonal deliciousness, and a good selection of fruit as well (well, now, anyway).  They have tomatoes and apples and potatoes in varieties you've never heard of, the biggest squash I've ever seen, people handing out random samples of goodness. flowers, cheese, bread, herbs (do not miss the fresh herbs stand, it is BOMB and so cheap and they have kale and other beautiful greens), pastries, toffee. the Amish people who sell the yummy food, mushrooms (ew but whatever), jams/salsas, soap and a few other crafts, and some places where you can actually get lunch instead of just ingredients!\n\nI'm depressed that I only have 2 more months to go here.  Green City Market isn't convenient for me and this place is the next best of the city markets, in my eyes.  You will find me here every Thursday until the end of October.  I'll be the weirdo getting funny looks in the elevator because I have a massive heap of basil sticking out of my purse.",

                "description": "All these years working downtown, and never have I stopped to check out the Farmer's Market.  It wasn't until a brisk fall morning waiting at the bus, when I spotted a lady with 4 loaves of bread.  She initiated conversation with me, stating that she was looking for her favorite bus driver to give him a loaf of her Labriola garlic parmesan French bread.  Garlic parmesan... \"Where did you get those from?\", trying not to sound too desperate.  She pointed and said, \"Right across the street\".  \n\nShe then went on to state that they had fried cheese there, lots of local farmers with fresh produce and bakeries for some morning goodies.  I looked at my watch, and knew that making a detour before work that morning was impossible but dutily noted to leave earlier for work the next week. \n\nMorning meetings, cuddling up in a warm bed on a cool morning, unpacking after a work move...none motivate me to leave earlier for work.  Nope? And what does? Obviously some garlic parmesan bread. \n\nSo the next week, I left a little earlier and upon arriving, I knew to make a beeline for Labriola.  My bus occupant said they sell out fast, so that was the treasure that I was looking for.  I bought one loaf at $4 and knew if I fell in love with it, that the Paleo diet would be history.  I also bought an almond croissant at Delightful Pastries for $3 or so which completed my morning breakfast.  \n\nThe almond croissant was very good.  Flaky, crusty, airy, but could've used more almond paste inside it.  The garlic parmesan loaf was incredible.  Wonderful ratio of garlic to parmesan, and if consumed within 24 hours, a great texture as well.  Don't try to ration out the loaf over a few days, or it will be hard as a rock.  \n\nI sampled the hot cheese they had simmering up.  For whatever particular reason, the curds don't really melt into a glob, and stay in curd form.  The salesman reassured me that they would hold up the day without being refrigerated, but I just made another mental note to pack a small cooler on my next visit. \n\nFarmer's Market is only open till next Thursday, Oct 18th this year from  7 am- 3 pm.  On the last day, for the very first time, they will be have a Red Meat Market with chefs, butchers and guest speakers throughout the day....more mental notes for the folks who want to remember to bring their coolers that day",

During your visit if you come across the Brunkow Cheese booth make sure you stop by to see if they are grilling up some yummy cheese samples.

The fountain and the Picasso are such a cool backdrop for the stands ands their umbrellas.  This market has a bit of everything.  You can pick up a great selection of fresh produce, including a generous bunch of kale for a dollar!  The raspberries were beautiful and much less expensive than their grocery store counterparts.  There are quite a few stands that sell ready to go meals, like noodle bowls and sandwiches.  My favorites are the vegan tamales and vegan fruit bars.  While you're at it you can pick up a nice bunch of fresh flowers.  There are several flower stands to choose from.  A lot of loop workers visit the market at lunchtime.  It opens early so you can also swing by and pick up your morning fruit.  The energy is great here, and the market is much more extensive than some of the little neighborhoods ones.",

They have more produce than my neighborhood farmers market. They also seemed to have a lot of great lunch time options that could be eaten right away. I was surprised by how large the space was. There were tons of produce for what seemed to be pretty inexpensive. Also, they had so many gorgeous flowers! I love buying flowers at farmers markets, they just make the day better! \n\nThere is also the relaxing fountain you can stop and eat or relax at during your lunch break. I will definitely be coming back (and have cash with me!) This is a great way to take a few minutes and relax from the work day. Go check it out!",

Trying to wake me up is kind of like poking a sleeping bear with a stick, others can verify this. However, the Loop farmer's markets have me waking up early of my own volition.\n\nMy usual market is the Federal Plaza market on Tuesdays, but when I forgot to pick up a few items I decided to visit Daley Plaza on Thursday. There are many of the same vendors and good number of ones not represented at Federal Plaza too. I had come for two items, but before I knew it I was toting a very heavy bag full of apples, tomatoes, cookies, bagels, and broccoli back to my office.\n\nMy one regret is that I didn't get turned on to this market earlier in the season, it really is a gem. They have pretty much everything you'll see at a weekend neighborhood market, but with fewer crowds, strollers and kids, which in my book is a huge bonus.\n\nYou only have a few more weeks to partake so hustle your butt over there!\n\nThursdays.

Of course farmer's markets cater to what's in season locally, and locally here usually means Michigan or downstate IL. Several Michigan farms had fresh asparagus, herbs for planting and flowers for planting. \n\nYou want a 2 ft. tomato plant that you absolutely cannot kill at this point? Here you go! Herb plantings were plentiful, and already fully grown; including basil, cilantro, rosemary, mint, oregano. Grow your own, as they say!\n\nThere's also artisanal breads, fresh baked goods,a kind of \"hip\" Roller Derby-type girl selling \"cutting edge\" baked goods,  fresh honey and the list goes on and on. I really liked how spacious the Daley Center Farmer's Market is, because it's a pain being elbow to elbow with someone and fighting over the last stalk of dinosaur kale!\n\nI vow to wake up early on Thursdays, pack my canvas Yelp tote, and stop here on my way to work this summer. Do I sense you getting a little \"green\"?",

And most of the really good vendors from Green City are there anyway.  \n\nGreat selection of veggies, fruit, flowers, baked goods, cheese, and other pickled treats and jams.  Its a great reason to support local farms, eat in season (because its good for you and it just tastes better when its supposed to be eaten), and get outside.  Seeing all the colors alone is a visual treat.\n\nFarmers markets are not for everyone, but they should be.  Sure they cost a little more that crappy store produce, but you know where your food came from and can ask the person that grew it any questions you have about how it was grown, the best way to cook it, and how much longer you will be able to get it.  Its completely worth the extra few dollars total, and the taste of fresh veggies and fruit will blow you mind.\n\nHighly recommend, go check it out and bring cash!",

And, I gotta say, I am a cheese addict. And, there is plenty of cheese!\n\nI'm not overly interested in the fresh produce...The prices are generally higher than at my grocery store (Meijer). But, they do have some varieties of veggies that are not available at regular grocery stores (think purple potatoes and peppers you've never heard of, for example), so that is a plus.\n\nI'm in it for the dairy. There are several booths that offer various cheeses. And, a big plus, they offer samples! In recent weeks I have bought some tasty garlic-cheese spreads (2 for $10) at one booth and a chunk of bacon-cheddar cheese at another, among other things. Both were well worth it--the bacon cheddar went great on breakfast sandwiches and the spreads were a great companion to the football Sunday snack offerings.\n\nAnother highlight for me is the baked goods. Labriola has a booth where last week I obtained two nice pieces of Ciabatta bread which inspired some tasty Italian sandwiches for dinner that night. Also, there is another booth that sells some really good bagels...I got pizza ones and they were excellent.\n\nI will defintiely be sad to see the market go once chilly weather prevails...There's always next year to look forward to, though!",

During many market days here, there is also some sort of Daley Plaza cultural fest going on also, such as Turkish fest, Thai, etc along with stage entertainment.  There was even a celebrity chef cook-off some weeks back, that was fun to watch.\n\nLately the apple crop is in full swing and there are no less than 20 varieties available.  Honeycrisp is a personal favorite.  Also, be sure to checkout the Amish vendor and pickup some of their peanut brittle.  Its amazing.  Organic, raw honey from Kress Apiary is top-notch.

I have this insane yearning to try them all, I do wish there was such a thing as FMA ;-) \n\nSo, I wandered on over to this market this afternoon, actually stumbled upon it on accident because I was simply on my way to dropping off my tax appeal (stupid cook county!). What a nice market this is, they have loads of booths for fresh produce, baked goods, and also flowers. It is also very spacious which makes this chica very happy. It seems to get crowded during the lunch hour and how lucky are the folks who work near here?!?!?! Since it is mainly a work crowd here, one major bonus: NO STROLLERS, thank goodness!! \n\nIt was nice to wander around and see what was being offered, it was also very nice to actually talk to the farmers and hear a little about their products. I loved the people from Kress Apiary, they were so personable & funny--definitely want to visit their farm. I did notice that this FM has more baked good/bakeries stands than other FM I have been to this summer. This is definitely a smart move since you are looking at people on lunch breaks, they usually come hungry. One place I was more than happy to buy baked goods from; Misericordia. Not only do I get yummy cookies and blueberry bread, I can feel good about it too since it goes for a great cause. \n\nSo, if you work near here or are in the area on a Thursday, stop on by & get yourself some delicious food.",

                "description": "This is the first new review I've done in a while so I'm gonna be a little quick about it.  Recently I've been hitting up farmer's markets and trying to eat a little bit healthier and support local farmers. Going to farmer's markets around here is also a  great way for me to kill some time and  see all this great food and produce. \n\n    I got up later than I thought, 10am with a bad headache. I still managed to head on over to the market and it was very crowded but still had enough space to walk around comfortably.\n\n   *Quick note: Yuppie parents, for the love of Zesus please, PLEASE, quit bringing those damn wide ass, double-decker, pimped out strollers to places you damn well know are gonna be crowded! \n\n    Anyway, there were a lot of stands to go around and browse at. \nWhile some of the produce didn't look the best to me, I was pretty happy with all the different selections of food. Some stands I would defiantly go back to are: \n\n*The Bleeding Hearts Bakery salted caramel cupcake- Very sweet and rich. Drink milk if you buy, the strawberry rhubarb cupcake looked good as well but I didn't get it.\n\n* This berry stand with this goofy guy from Michigan- I tried these raspberries he was selling and they were the sweetest I've ever tasted! \n\n-His black and strawberries were sweet too and he has a 4 pint for $15 deal so you can mix and match them. \n\n* All the bakery stands goods looked so tasty and a couple of them raise money for good causes.\n\n* As I said before, some of the produce didn't look the best but the prices are a bit lower than other markets and I saw a lot of variety. \n\nSo, if you live at any of the school dorms downtown or your looking to do something different for your lunch break, Check It Out!\n\nP.S. Whoever took the napa cabbage I was about to buy, I WILL FIND YOU!",

After returning to the country from a seven week trip, the first thing I wanted to do was get some good, homegrown midwest produce.\n\nI got to the market yesterday at about 8:30 a.m., and was surprised to see practically no one shopping. I know it's in the heart of the Loop, but one vendor had delicious-looking bagels for breakfast and another had beautiful scones! This would be a great place to pick up a nice, light breakfast before work.\n\nThere were a good amount of vendors at the market, which was nice so I shopped around for the best prices on my fruits and veggies. I found the prices to be pretty reasonable, less than the Green City market. I walked away with two bags of fruits, veggies, and bread for less than $20. \n\nAlong with 5 or 6 produce vendors, there were a couple baked good vendors as well as some clothing and jewelry and flowers. Weird, but good. \n\nOverall I'd definitely return to this market because the prices are right and the produce is impeccable.",

                "description": "Somehow, even though I looked forward to every Farmer's Market Thursday, I almost always managed to forget my reusable tote bags.  I blame it on being too groggy when I left for work in the morning... but by the time 11am rolled around, my friend and co-worker Laura B. and I were wide awake and hurrying down to the market, hoping we'd be able to haul all our goodies back to the office with us.\n\nSo, so, SO MUCH good stuff!!  Artisan breads, homemade jams, jellies and salsas, absolutely addictive Amish toffee, pies and cookies, mushrooms, cheeses, Michigan peaches (God, they were SO good last season!!) and other delicious fruits, all manner of veggies out the wazoo, tons of bright, beautiful flowers and our very own Bee Man (you know, the guy who brings his bees and all their delicious honey)...  In the early autumn, you can get tasty caramel apples that were dipped that day or take your pick from many lovely pumpkins and gourds... I just loved this market.  It's a great source for fresh produce during the growing season and visiting the market is like going on a little vacation during the work day--so many lovely things to look at and sample.\n\nMost Thursdays, I left work with an embarrassing amount of produce that made riding the L home a bit challenging, but once I tasted those fresh tomatoes or those juicy peaches (so freakin' good!), it certainly made the haul worth it... especially the time I brought home a giant stalk of still-attached Brussels sprouts.  I had to carry it on the train like a baby and everyone looked at me like I was nuts--but damn, those were some tasty little guys!\n\nThank you, Farmer's Market, for making sure I had such tasty, fresh food to eat and for giving me a break from Cubicle Land.  Come back soon and I'll bring my bags.",

The cherries and strawberries looked so fresh that I couldn't resist buying a bag of cherries, even after a big lunch. The cakes, breads, and cookies looked delicious as well!  My only complaint was that there weren't any peaches, but I guess they aren't in season yet and will be there in just a few weeks. This farmers market is open every Thursday from 7 am- 3 pm and I definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't yet.",

                "description": "Thursdays are wild at the Daley Plaza and each Thursday keeps getting better and better.  Today I found myself in front of the Rise 'n Roll Bakery; a lovely group from Middlebury, IN.  Dressed in garb similar to the Amish, these people are Farmer's market to the core.  And they produce some of the best baked goods I've had so far.  They had homemade granola, pasta, cheese, cookies and so many other delicious looking things that I could have spent $200 at their tent.  I will be back to visit them!  I also love purchasing a variety of fruits and vegetables from the Nichols Farm & Orchard.  These people also know how to produce some great tasting food!\n\nFor those of you who haven't been, the Daley plaza farmer's market contains many of the same booths as the federal plaza farmer's market on Tuesday, plus a few more.  In season fruits and vegetables can be found as well as a variety of baked goods.  If you work in the area, stop by before work for the best selection or make a trip down for lunch.  Why spend $10 on lunch to get a sandwich when you can grab lunch from a farmer's market?  Go now and show these locals how much we appreciate their efforts.",

Taking a short stroll through the market, looking at stalls of flowers and fresh fruit, vegetables and baked goods makes this a great way to start the day.\n\nA lot of the farmers and vendors here are also at Green City Market, so if you are fan of that one, this is certainly worth a browse.

                "description": "Is it Thursday yet? Is it Thursday yet? Is it Thursday yet?! Sigh...why must this Farmers Market only run every Thursday until October 15th, from 7 am - 3 pm? There are just too many tasty and beautiful things here to pack into one day a week! \n\nSituated in the famous Daley Plaza, it is either a bad idea or a very good idea to visit this Farmers Market while you are hungry. It's bad in that you buy a lot, but it's good in that things aren't too expensive. \n\nMini reviews of some of my recent haul: \n\n- This morning I just finished off the last bit of DELICIOUS Zucchini Bread, baked by the beautiful people at Misericordia, a great non-profit organization assisting children and adults born with developmental disabilities (http://www.misericordia.com/). They mostly sell loaves of Irish Soda Bread, Banana Bread, and other sweet loaves, that each cost $3.25 (or $3 apiece if you buy at least three). The loaves are so moist that you will regret that you only purchased one loaf. \n\n- Wisconsin cheese samples are evil, because they taste so good and cause you to buy a $5 bag of cheese curds that will take you two weeks to finish. The particular bag of cheese curds I bought was plain, though the booth also offered them in dill/garlic flavor. Oh don't tempt me! \n\n- Artisan Bread. For $1.50 you can buy a sandwich-sized garlic/marinara bun that makes a fantastic lunch. I suggest microwaving it for about 30 seconds to really bring out the softness and garlic taste of the bread. This artisan bread booth also sells pretzel bread loaves. \n\n- Fresh flowers. If this Farmers Market were on Monday, I would gladly purchase three giant sunflowers for my work desk, for $2! Boyfriends, take note if you're looking for weekend date bouquets. \n\n- Fresh vegetables and herbs. Sweet corn, tomatoes, potatoes, blueberries, raspberries, eggplant, squash, cabbage, lettuce, bok choy, cantaloupe -- you name it, it's there, and for CHEAP. I am definitely buying a $1 cabbage the next time I am there. I also can't believe I got a plastic shopping bag worth of fresh basil for $2! Mmmm...time for me to make some caprese salad! \n\n- Inept bamboo caretakers, you need GreenGreen, the bamboo fertilizer. You can purchase them here for a $1 per bottle, as well as bamboo plants, in case you've really killed your plants. \n\nOther stuff to check out include the Amish booth that sells fantastic cashew brittle, blueberry pies and strawberry angel food cakes. You can also buy oatmeal soaps, fresh jams and preserves, honey and chocolate from other vendors. \n\nI think I've convinced you. Yes.",

(Though I am a fan of Halloween Village, which will be set up shortly.)  There's nothing better than sneaking out of the office and strolling around here on a beautiful summer afternoon.\n\nI know most people go to farmer's markets for the produce, but I am not most people.  I go for the baked goods.  And oh my god, are there some amazing baked goods here.  My favorite booth is Misericordia's Hearts & Flour bakery.  Not only are their chocolate chip cookies (and brownies and lemon loaf and pumpkin bread) AMAZING, but the money earned goes to such a fabulous cause that you don't even feel guilty about consuming a million calories.  \n\nAlliance and Bleeding Heart bakeries have booths as well.  I'm kind of meh about both (I've written a separate review for Bleeding Heart if you're interested), but at least you're able to check out them out without making a separate trip.\n\nAlso present are La Briola (love the pretzel bread and the foccacia!), Rise N' Roll (a fine Amish bakery with great muffins and nut brittles) and some Polish bakery whose name is escaping me at the moment (I never tried their stuff, but I did eye their pineapple upside-down cake and butter cookies on quite a few occasions..... maybe next year).\n\nThe booth for Kress Apiary has part of a beehive behind glass, so you can watch hundreds of bees crawling around and vomiting pollen..... I mean, making honey.  It's fascinating and gross all at the same time, and I'm compelled to check it out every week.\n\nThere are several vendors selling flowers, which are an incredible value here.  You can buy a HUGE, colorful, beautiful bouquet of wildflowers for about $5 or so.  Which means that if you're a guy and you work nearby, you have no excuse for not bringing your wife or girlfriend flowers at least once during the summer.\n\nAnd of course, there's all the booths for fresh fruit and vegetables.  (I did buy cherries a couple of times this year, and they were perfect every single time.)  And a couple for cheese and fresh meats and jellies and all that other stuff you can buy at a farmer's market.  If only someone would set up a sandwich booth, they'd make a killing during lunch time.\n\nNow I'm stuck waiting for next summer.",

The corn is good, not great. \n \nGreen City Market, Logan Square's and the Lincoln Park school market on Armitage are all superior and no more expensive.\n\nFor those who desire authentic croissants and European pastry, a bakery like Vanille on Clybourn - the best French goods in the city by far - is the place to go.  I haven't found a farmer's market that offers high quality Eurpean pastry - well, why would they? Farmers don't produce pastry! Ha!

I went for the first time yesterday and was so pleasantly surprised that I had to run and find an ATM machine to buy all the fresh produce.  I didn't have nearly enough time on my lunch break to do the market justice but this was my final take-home:\n\nfresh picked green beans\nripe grape tomatoes\nGruyere cheese \nsmoked mozzarella\nhorseradish cheddar\nsugar-free blueberry jam\nbouquet of sunflowers\n1 pot of rosemary\n1 pot of cilantro\n1 pot of peppermint\n\nAll of this for $30!!!  The bouquet of sunflowers was only $1... where else can you buy beautiful flowers at that price in the city???  It was kind of a pain hauling my booty back to my apartment on the bus during rush hour but definitely worth it.

All in all, this is a great way to get the fresh produce we should all be enjoying.  I will definitely be going to this farmers market every Thursday until the end of the season and you should too!",

After coming out of heated court calls and dealing with mostly nasty people day in and day out in the courtrooms, Thursday Farmers Markets are really a de-stresser!\n\nThey have the yummiest cheeses and freshest pastries and beautiful flowers!

                "description": "One of my favorite Chicago things is when Farmers' Market (\"FM\") season begins. I usually hit up this one because it is close to work and makes for a great outing during my lunch break...especially when the weather is just calling my name to get outside. If lucky, you can snag a spot on one of the benches; eat lunch, hangout, or people watch.  It's a great place for people watching. \n\nI absolutely love getting my veggies, pastries (most of which make great afternoon snacks at work), and sometimes flowers here. I tend to browse the booths before purchasing anything. My mom laughs now when I tell her I stock up on vegetables. As a kid, I despised eating vegetables (well, I did like one or two things) and here I am buying stuff I did not like when I was young. I am a sucker for apple and pumpkin butters, and there is one stand (sorry but I cannot recall the actual name of the vendor!) which sells varieties of jellies, jams, and butters. Apple and pumpkin butters = yummy in my tummy. There is usually a deal 2 jars (jams, etc.)  for $7, I think.\n\nIt tends to get super busy during 12-2 PM, and I like to go towards the end when people are heading back to their offices (and just before FM closes). My theory does not always turn out as expected - still crowded. Oh well.  :-)",

Everything from baked goods like pies, breads, and cookies, coffee, fresh fruits and veggies to potted plants and herbs, bath salts, soaps and things for your home. I am kicking myself now because there was a lady there with organic cleaning products, one thing I picked up, I think was a spray cleaner for the kitchen ..smelled like an Orange Grove! I meant to go back but I got sidetracked. Hopefully she will be there next week. All the vendors I bought from or chatted with were friendly and helpful. We will be back next week. Also...for you parents, all of the vendors were so kid friendly. My 6 year old had a great time too!",

During the summer, I stock up on fresh cucumbers, zucchini, and tomatoes. The fruit sold is often Michigan apples which tends to be a little pricey; you've been forewarned. I sometimes buy the berries as well if they look good and aren't too expensive for a farmer's market price. The bakeries represented often include Misercordia and Bleeding Heart bakery. Since baked goods are one of my downfalls, I tend to avoid it, though tempting. Last summer, one of the vendors sold pickled aspargus which some of my coworkers picked up right away too. I often stop by before work to stock up because the vegetables go pretty fast and then have fresh veggies chilling in my work fridge during the day. Go early and stock up. The farmer's market is another one of those nice things that brightens the dank, dark Daley Center up once in a while.",
