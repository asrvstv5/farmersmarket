            "description": "Same thing other people have said: awesome French market, but it gets crazy crowded, especially later in the day. That being said, there are a variety of vendors, from produce and flowers to baked goods to meat to clothing and jewelry to books. It is a pretty stable group of vendors, that is, it's pretty much the same vendors in the same place each time.\nEveryone I've met is really friendly. Prices do vary quite a bit from one vendor to another, especially with produce. \nOur favorite thing is to ride our bikes over on Saturday morning. There's a fair amount of parking, especially in the garage (across from the DuPage Medical Group building), but it's really easy to bike there since it's right off the prairie path.\nConvenient access to downtown Wheaton for whatever else you may need/want (i.e. the library, Carlson's hardware, etc.)",

            "description": "When I lived in Illinois, I loved this French Farmers Market in Wheaton. It had to be one of my first stops when I came back to town. My favorite memory about this market was buying a huge tropical beach painting from one of the vendors. It was one of my hubby and I's wedding presents to each other.\n\nThis time around it was as great as I thought it would be. They have tons of little local vendors selling their crafts, food, popcorn, ice teams, clothes, flowers, jewelry, and home d\u00e9cor. \n\nThere's a lot to see and several rows of it. It has a nice location by the train station and steps from Downtown Wheaton.\n\nOne thing that I noticed after the fact when I had already been through the market is that they are not dog friendly. My dog was walking all throughout the market with no problem. Than at the end, I see the small sign that says no dogs allowed. I don't understand how that could be the case when this is outside. Either way, no one stopped us with him walking around and it was fine.\n\nAnother thing is that there really aren't that many food vendors as I thought that would be. there was a popcorn vendor, a bakery, some coffee, and maybe about 2 or 3 more food vendors. There was not much selection, so if you are hungry just keep that in mind and check out something in downtown Wheaton.",

            "description": "I'm taking one star off simply because it gets PACKED! As in you can't move while attempting to walk through the aisles. And then people bring their kids, strollers, and dogs, and you think all hell is about to break loose.\n\nThe assortment of vendors is great though. Flowers, produce, meats, bakery, coffee, jewelry, skincare, etc. It's all there, and it's all beautiful and wonderful. I love it when vendors give out samples - we bought several things we otherwise wouldn't have!\n\nDefinitely get there early! By 10am, you could see inventory had already starting to decline. Plenty of other shops and restaurants to visit while your in the area, and a beautiful little walking path by the library as well!",

            "description": "Overrated and overcrowded. Go here when they open and a lot of stuff isn't set up. Go here late and a lot of stuff is sold out. Go here in the middle and the parking lot on Willow is really backed up and precarious. Totally crowded at 10:30AM, can't even move. Now here's where my complaining really begins:\n\nI know it's a \"French market\" and not a \"farmers' market\" but the fact that this place is 9-10x more jewelry and pastries than produce is ridiculous. That's kind of depressing, and the little bit of farmer's stands is not super great either. Out of this whole place, only one is organic produce. Just one stand. And they sell out of stuff QUICK.  \n\nThe other places have been mostly disappointing. Instead of growing and selling spring crops locally in the spring, they'd rather sell summer crops from Florida. And they all had these southern Illinois strawberries that were all bruised and looked like they were going bad. It seems like they all got them from the same distributor/farm or whatever. They aren't selling things they grow for the most part. The one nice thing I got was some Michigan hydroponic tomatoes that were very fresh and broccoli. Let's hope they taste as good as they look, and let's hope the southern Illinois strawberries (which I got out of curiosity) taste a whole lot better than they look. I thought local food was supposed to be fresher than grocery store food? Not always. Maybe those tomatoes will bring me back to fight the crowds next week but they'd have to be pretty damn good.",

It was a win-win!\n\nWe went earlier in the day to avoid the crowds that gather here in downtown Wheaton. But by the time we left, it was getting crowded and the strollers had made their way to the aisles. So yes, come early. \n\nI started making purchases almost immediately. I think that may have been a mistake. Similar vendors had similar products at a lower cost as I moved up and down the aisles. If you have the time, I would encourage you to look at everything and then make your decisions. But if there's a limited supply of things - get it while the getting is good!  \n\nLet's talk about some of my favorites...\n\nWe tried some honey. It was marvelous!  Different honey combos jarred up and ready to go. They even had mini jars available so you could take home a variety. I loved that I could taste the options before I purchased. Thank you, Bron's Bee Honey!!\n\nSt. Roger Abbey was there complete with nuns and baked goods. Another win when we ate that chocolate tartlet.\n\nDenny's Acres supplied me with Yukon gold potatoes that I split over two dinners and some gorgeous baby asparagus. They had a nice variety of produce to offer and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this local vendor again!\n\nI tried tea from two different vendors. Both were good, but I preferred The Tea House. The gentleman working that booth really knew his stuff and I was sold on the Tea-Vine without even tasting it. I've since tasted it and it's exactly as he described. Nice!\n\nThere were at least two meat vendors, but I was wooed by Farm Fresh Foodstuffs. Yet another knowledgable man in the crowd. He had a lot to say and I ended up a big fan after a few minutes of chatting. I bought two different types of bacon. My girlfriend bought ground beef. And it looks like they may be able to help with a raw diet for a special Princess I know. :-)\n\nHahn's Bakery from Geneva was here. I am already a day of Hahn's, so I was on the hunt for a kitchen sink cookie, but alas they did not bring those for the day. Although, I did hear they were asked by multiple people, so it may make its way into their French Market inventory in the future. You never know... What they did provide were fresh baked pretzel rolls and still warm donuts. No, not warm from the sun...but warm from the onsite fryer. They're making that magic happen on the premises. It was a perfect way to wrap up a delicious morning at the market!",

Here you'll find fresh crepes, beautiful flowers, fruit and vegetables, handcrafted soaps, jewelry, knick knacks, it has it all.  \n\nThere's 4 aisles of local fare and most of the vendors are friendly, save the jewelry lady who was extra snarky.  My top pic for jewelry here is Adorn512.  Such a delicate and unique but trendy selection. \n\nAbout the crowds though.  I'd recommend either coming early to avoid them and have first pick of the best produce.",

            "description": "I love spending my Saturday mornings walking around Farmer's Markets. I've been to the Wheaton French Market three times already since moving to Wheaton. \n\nThe vendor offerings are pretty good and I always find myself leaving with at least a few goodies. You can find expect to find macarons, coffee, pastries, bread, olives, pickles, dog treats, jewelry, gluten-free goodies and don't forget about the fruits and veggies. \n\nThe good:\n-You're supporting small business owners and farmers\n-It's a good way to discover new products or items you haven't tried before\n-All your favorite Wheaton businesses are in one convenient location\n-Lots of vendors take both cash and cards! Huge pro\n\nThe meh:\n-No dogs allowed. Although my dogs aren't well behaved enough to visit such an event, I always love meeting other dog owners and seeing the pups around. \n-The space itself is incredibly narrow-- which probably has a lot to do with why no dogs are allowed.\n-Parking is tough unless you get here right when it starts or a little before. You might find yourself driving in circles for parking for awhile. I was here at 745 one morning and had my share of parking spots. \n\nThe bad:\n-No real cons that would keep me from coming\n\nI'll continue coming to The French Market as long as the weather and my work schedule allows. It's a great way to spend a relaxing Saturday morning.",

            "description": "Maybe this market has declined since the previous reviews. It is messy. The vendors are crammed into, too small of an area making it uncomfortable to navigate THEM AND the patrons who feel it necessary to bring strollers or walking dogs.  I LIKE kids and dogs, but the little ones get bags in their faces, trip people up and see only butts and legs (and dogs). Both are safety hazards.\nThere are also too few garbage bins and it is common to see used toothpicks from samples littering the food product tables. This market has 3 notable vendors, cheese; pretzel/bread and knife sharpener. All others are price-gougers and slopping messers!",

Oh, that, and pretty much dodging all the bees flying around all the vendors with sweets and produce.  \n\nThis is one of the best markets in the Illinois suburbs.  4 rows of local arts and crafts and also baked goods and produce.  Love the fall season especially because of the squashes.  My favorite so far are acorn and butternut.  It's decently priced...you may find it to be cheaper at the grocery but hey, its a french market.  My Saturday mornings have been spent here for the past 2 weeks.  \n\nMy advice: stop by the vendors with the baked goodies.  Best find so far among the bakery vendors was a loaf of Chocolate chip pumpkin bread.  Pair that with a hot mug of apple cider and you're seriously on cloud 9.\n\nOh and yes, they have a crepes station!",

OMG, YES!), a grilled cheese shop, and others I can't possibly remember.\n\nThe earlier you get there the better as there is a lot to see but it's all crammed in a very small area - and once those mommies wielding their double-wide ankle destroyers, um, I mean, strollers, get out & about, it's a bit cramped.

This farmers market is really great, however, it can be difficult to navigate with the crowds while finding a place to park.

You can find anything from tea, to homemade dog treats, to flowers for your garden, there are even a couple of food truck/vendors.

There's a *lot* of bread as well, and there are some nuns sell both savory and sweet bread. \n\nVegetables and fruit can be hit or miss. If it's out of season in the midwest, expect the fruit you find to be trucked up from Florida. Nothing wrong with that, and the peaches *were* good... but next time I'll wait the extra month.\n\nIt's conveniently located in downtown Wheaton and there's always a bustle of activity, live music, many pounds of frozen blueberries (which we did get one year; they were very good)... in generally, this is what I would expect a farmers' market to be.",

Long and short of it: we won't be back. \n\n1: the aisles. Everyone has done a great job punting out they are too narrow. It's horrid! We aren't in Paris! Spread it out a little more. \n\n2: the non-food vendors: while I understand this is a French Market, the numerous vendors peddling various other goods just cramps up the area. We only came for food!\n\n3: the \"grocery\" produce: perhaps my biggest irk. We go to farmers markets to buy local, supporting the local farmers, to eat in the season and get the freshest, whole foods we can. How in the world are tomatoes from Arizona(as it said on the box) fit in that? Some purveyors had so any different varieties of produce that it was obvious that they are not growing them but purchasing them at wholesale and turning a profit on people none the wiser. Talk to the vendors people! I found a certified organic farm from Michigan that was able to fulfill my need for cucumbers, tomatoes and kale but some of you may of bought the same stuff being sold at Mariano's down the street! \n\nA few reviewers said that the food was more expensive than the grocery store. It can be. But we pay more to support the local farmers and sometimes it's a better deal than the chemically enhanced, grown in a lab, cross bred stuff found at the grocery store. You pay a premium to eat good the way it looks grown from a seed with little to no human intervention!!\n\nIn the end we won't come back. There are so many farmers markets now and this one for the reasons above is just not worth the time.",

Forget taking your dog to Wheaton small aisles crowded.\n\nGo Early and yes it has become very expensive!!!!",

                "description": "I love the French market Downtown Wheaton! I must say not being from here the first time I went a few years ago I didn't know what to expect and boy did I feel silly when I realize a French Market is a what I would call a Farmers Market! \nEverything is fresh and yummy but can be a little costly especially the grapes. You can buy anything from produce to honey to kettle corn to clothes here. Kettle corn has become a must for my kids every time we go and the couple making it is so nice. It's delicious. Also there are homemade chocolate croissant from Suzette's which are amazing, I'm totally in love with it. Trust me and try one!\nThe farmers market gets pretty crowded and I found to be a little stressful navigating a stroller through for me so I try not to bring mine. Also it's street parking but there are parking garages (for free) close by so don't let that discourage you from stopping by!",

It's less crowded, with everybody acting less eager and more relaxed. Just our speed.\n\nIced coffee from I Have a Bean is a favorite of ours. There are usually two booths selling flowers, as well as two businesses selling kettle corn (one tent and one truck). I bought a floppy sunhat from the floppy sunhat vendor, only to have the brim fall apart a few weeks later. When I brought it back to them, they were really nice about exchanging the ruined one for a new one (the new one has held up fine, so I think the first one was a fluke).\n\nWe really enjoyed Annalee, the singer/guitarist who performed here often earlier in the summer. Her music added to the vibe of the market. As far as upkeep, we've noticed the trash cans overflowing a few times, as well as the connection to the fire hydrant leaking. It would be nice if they stayed on top of that (\"they\" haha...I don't really know who \"they\" is in this case, but hopefully \"they\" see what I'm saying).",

We find ourselves picking up the fresh breads, cheeses, hand crafted jewelry (love the Karma Cords and Chicatolia products). In fact, we discovered a cleaning product for our granite (Supreme Surface) that we absolutely love... This market is the bomb!!!

Also, since it's small it's crowded and hard to navigate. A double stroller took up the entire aisle just as we were leaving on Saturday. \n\nThe free parking in the nearby parking garage is definitely a plus.  It's just a short walk to and from the market.  \n\nIt's ok, but not great. I'd be happier if it was bigger or just a bit more spread out.",

It was great.\n\nThere were about 3 long rows of vendors with their goods. I couldn't believe the variety of items that were being sold: produce, pastries, breads, jewelry, purses, dog treats, cheeses, jams, honey, pickled beets, flowers, shrubs, popcorn, crepes, coffee, roasted nuts, wine, and the list goes on and on.\n\nWe ended up with quite a haul: sweet corn (the best I've had), mix for a dip (just add cream cheese), artisan bread, and some yummy garlic and dill cheese curds. We even ate breakfast there - a crepe! mine was lemon curd and blueberry and was delicious.\n\nWe had no trouble parking at all - there was street parking, a garage, and a parking lot to use.  We brought our dog, who was allowed outside of the rows of goods, but not inside. It was pretty packed at 10am on a Saturday, which I expect is fairly typical.\n\nMy one gripe: the rows are too close together. It was a hot day made hotter with many people in a small space. There were times when I couldn't even get by someone in the aisle. Just a little more space in between, please.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the morning. People and vendors are super friendly, and there are samples galore.",

Various flower stands, probably greater variety of flowers than Naperville's Saturday farmer's market, didn't pick any flowers up in Wheaton to compare scent/freshness/longevity. Variety of baked goods. A little on the pricey side; a bit pricier than Naperville's, it felt, for most of the produce.\n\nThe tight aisles are a pretty big annoyance, especially when people with strollers get involved, as others have noted. As this market is much closer than Naperville's, might alternate between this and Naperville market remainder of this season, next season.\n\nDrove through/past this for many weeks, thinking Wheaton's \"farmer's market\" was on Thursdays only. Thought this was some kind of street fair with people milling about and the tightly-packed white-awning'd stands. What makes this a \"French\" market? Seems like any other farmer's market to me. Is \"French market\" a Chicagoland or Midwestern thing? I'm a transplant from upstate NY ...\n\nWe noticed the Thai food stand while walking back to the car, loaded down with veggies. We unloaded at the car and came back for the Thai. Great pad thai tofu, could use more sprouts; pretty decent peanut sauce. Mango salsa has little to no heat. Chicken-on-a-stick (chicken bangkok?) was ok but nothing special; a bit dry.",

                "description": "I find this market to be the most infuriating.  Lots of great stuff - produce, bread, meat, crafts, you name it.  But why does it have to be crammed in such a tiny space?  Holy cats!  It's almost impossible to move.  I'd be a fan of not allowing strollers or widening the aisles or something to keep people moving along.  It's just really hard to shop when packed in that tight.  Makes me cranky because there were things I wanted but couldn't get close enough to them to actually make a purchase.",

                "description": "The French Market in Wheaton seems to me to get better each year.  I am fortunate to live close enough to walk there and do so just about every weekend.  During the summer it can be crowded and hard to move around as people stop to look at merchandise and chat with the storekeepers, so if you're the impatient type you may find it frustrating.  But if you go equipped with patience and the right attitude, I think you'll find it fun and well worthwhile.  Tip: arrive early in the morning, before it gets too packed.  \n\nYou can find everything from handmade jewelry, clothing and home decor to all kinds of edibles including flavored olive oils, to produce and baked goods to fresh milk, eggs, delicious handmade granola and more.  Not to mention most amazing flowers, so fresh they last so much longer than those I've purchased elsewhere.  The local \"I've Got a Bean\" coffee producers have a stand and you can see many people sipping a cup of their brew as they stroll.  I am a big fan of Hahn's Bakery that has a great stand here each week--wonderful breads and pastries.  \n\nNow that the season has changed from summer to fall, the crowds have thinned out a bit and it's easier to get around.  This is the time to get wonderful apples.  I particularly like the Honey Crisp apples from a Michigan grower--crisp, tart and much more flavorful and less expensive than the grocery store variety.  Also, huge pots of mums in every hue, reasonably priced, to decorate your doorstep. \n\nThe French Market is open until early November.  How I miss it when it closes but its re-opening each year is one of my favorite signs of spring!",

                "description": "I like this farmer's market, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to call it a \"French Market.\" It is a smaller market, and that's fine but I come to a farmer's market for fresh, local produce, flowers, baked items, and maybe some unique, hand-made crafts. Instead, I find this market to be a little thin on produce and heavier on snack items and things to win over all the kids in strollers.\n\nAt this market, there's not much variety of produce and many of the stalls are for random \"craft\" or \"specialty items\" (e.g. Pampered Chef, imported scarves, children's tutus??). And, what really made me suspicious was the one time I went and a vendor had tangerines! Tangerines? At a Midwest farmer's market?? Plus, it's pricier here than the markets in downtown Chicago, which does not make sense to me.\n\nBut, it's not all bad--there are definitely some gems out there, like the doughnut stand, Lynfred Winery, and I like that grass-fed beef is available. There are several baked goods stands that look awesome. Wheaton has a nice atmosphere (despite the high school kids wandering around giggling and the strollers that can block the small aisles) and I love all the unique food shops. It's just that I would expect more from their \"French Market.\" No tangerines, please!",

                "description": "I'm torn on whether or not to give the Wheaton French Market three or four stars. Everyone was complaining about the narrow aisles, and yes, they are, but I think it creates more an environment that you are at a farmer's market and it keeps the pace busy. I loved that there was already wine sampling at 8:30AM, a paella/crepes stand, lemonade stand, and a musician. For ambiance and environment, I give it a four, however for the food that was provided I give it a three. There were not as many organically certified produce as I would have liked. The options are limited as well, I could not find all of my leafy green vegetables. Some stands had reasonable prices and I did buy some produce there but there were other stands that were outrageously expensive! A small bag of spinach that was not even filled up all the way was seven dollars! I was under the impression that this place was going to be cheaper than Whole Foods, but not even close, in fact, they were more expensive! I did appreciate the beautiful flower stands, and found a little polish bakery stand where I bought my boyfriend kolaskis that reminded him of his grandmother's. I will return but it will be once in a while, definitely not a weekly or bi-weekly event.",

We tasted cheeses, buffalo steaks, favored oils and sauces, purchased bits here and there, then decided to buy a dozen beautiful roses for $15.  \n\nThere are food huts, including a thai place and a hot dog stand for the kids. Today a vendor was serving fresh strawberry crepes.  Most people wander around with gigantic scones in their hands from Suzette's Creperie or cookies from one of he other bakeries that peddle their goodies.   (Try a kitchen sink cookie...yowsa!)  Don't get your coffee before you go as you won't have an empty hand to fondle things on tables.  Take a hip basket from which to dangle your newly purcased flowers, so others can ask where you bought them. \n\nWhy 4 1/2 stars then?  It's become a victim of it's own success.  The market gets very crowded and can be a pain to get through.  The stroller crowd arrives about 10a and that jams up the place fast.   The market runs this year from April 29th through October 28th.  Get there early...it's open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., but most of the vendors are packed up and loaded by 2.  Dogs are no longer allowed in the market area, but you and Fifi can sit on a bench and share a snack.\n\nMany of the other local suburbs have tried to copy our French Market but none have captured it as well as Wheaton.  But please, Wheaton, please...dplacez-vous  un plus grand endroit, s'il vous plat!  Or in layman's terms, please move your ass to a larger location.  It's getting crowded down here!  It may have been all those scones...",

Each week there seems to be something a little different.  Check out the guy selling the plants (plants are top quality, reasonably priced & always do well in my yard), Hansen's Bakery (crumb cake is delicious) & the necklaces/bracelets are Seize the Bead though pricey are great quality & creative.  A few complaints: for such an interesting little market to explore, the set up absolutely stinks.  The rows are too narrow, too crowded & dare you bring a stroller you will run over feet (plus get the stink eye - many times, understandably, because you're running over feet - sorry!).  The fact that they allow dogs in the market is also a disappointment.  It would be so much more inviting & enjoyable if they would move it to a more spacious area.  Wheaton has some beautiful parks within walking distance of this site - why not there?  If you attend closer to the afternoon, the crowds are much thinner.",

We look at pretty scarves and fancy jewelry, then stop at a grass fed meat stand. You can order a burger, or just purchase meat to cook at home. I am hungry, so i ask if we can stop at the (Korean?) food station. i orders me pot sticker and coconut shrimp, and it is wonderful. As we eat i stare at a stand with beautiful recycled shirts. On the way out we order a Hawaiian lemonade, and it is my favorite thing on earth. We carry the produce to the car, along with some Wisconsin cheese curds and some muffalata. Every thing is so delicious.",
