            "description": "Saturday 6/22/13 was the first Washington Farmers' Market. Because of the amount of rain we've had and flooded fields, produce may be a little slow this summer. My wife was quite pleased with the lettuce. Much better than store-bought, according to her. The radishes tasted good, but some were \"woody\". The strawberry preserves were excellent! We also had crafters come in: one lady all the way from Lincoln. Her shop is The Cloth Penguin, and she has baby bands, jewelry, skirts, and other stuff. Reach her at jfrawleyb@comcast.net. Another crafter had his wife staff the booth: thesycamoretree.net. He sells unique gift items. I'm looking forward to next Saturday when we might have more farmers show up. Northtown Farms specializes in pork burgers. Garden Marketplace specializes in vegetables.",
