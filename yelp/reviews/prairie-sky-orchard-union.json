            "description": "Love this place! Tons of apples (especially Honeycrisp), none of the poor animals sitting out in the sun that so many other places have, and the people who work here are very kind. It's not terribly crowded, either, and they have a cute shop for lunch with hot dogs and pulled pork sandwiches. Note about September 2018: the mosquitoes are INSANE. BRING INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUG SPRAY, and you'll be fine.",

Their apples are delicious and it's not expensive. And there's something about picking them fresh yourself! \n\nAlso, you must try their apple donuts!!! They are so soft and delicious and not very sweet. Also try their apple cider and a slice of apple pie. \n\nThere's a little store with other fresh goodies that you can take home with you. \n\nThe take cash or card.",

Kids had a great time minus all the frills!(no wagon rides/bounce houses, etc.) I would have given 5 stars if the little country shop offered more. I would have liked to grab pack of cider donuts and maybe caramel apples to go but no such luck.",

Also that 1-4 people for $19 only gets you ONE bag, so children can't even carry a small bag. Disappointing.",

Can buy 1 peck bags to fill, given picking instructions and able to pick as many apples that will fit into the bag. If not interested in picking apples, there is a cute shop to purchase already picked apples. Reasonably priced and great tasting apples. Will definitely return next season.",

            "description": "My husband and I were looking for a no-frills farm for apple picking, and this place is exactly that! Parking is free, there's no admission price and U-Pick apples are $19/peck. The orchard is well-organized so it's easy to find which types to pick. We picked a little of everything that was available (Golden Delicious, Fuji, Gala and Jonathan). I think Honeycrisp season is over, but they have them in the barn to purchase, along with various jams, butters and other local goods. Staff is super friendly and we enjoyed our visit! We'll definitely be back next year for more apples!",

We went on the last day of their season, and it was $1/lb, 25% off everything in the store. Besides apples, they also had some pears. Even though there weren't too many types of apples available, totally understandable since it was their last day. The apples were delicious, friendly owner, and we all genuinely enjoyed our time.",

The harvest wasn't great this year so no apple picking this year, but last year was great and so will next year.  Great people that run this orchard.  The dwarf apple trees are really great for kids to pick apples because they are so low to the ground.  I really like this place and we will be back for pumpkins later this fall.  \n\nThe produce is expensive just like you would expect for organic high end vegetables and fruit, however, there is no admission fee or other circus gimmicks which makes this a family friendly place to go on a budget.",

            "description": "When my wife (then girlfriend) and I met, we started a tradition of picking fresh apples in the fall so that she can bake delicious homemade pies.  We've tried a few places along the way, all in the outskirts of the suburbs, but Prairie Sky Orchard is BY FAR our favorite.\n\nWhat separates Prairie Sky is its lack of gimmicks.  Here, you won't be charged admission to enter; there's no carnival rides, no tourist traps, no overpriced concession stands.  Here, it's all about the apples and the pumpkins - everything you need to get your fall festivities going!\n\nHere's the trick to really enjoy it: pay attention to the weather and to their website.  Even though the farm has expanded the orchard and their pumpkin patch, this place has become so popular that they tend to run out!  \n\nIt's nothing but pure simplicity.  You get your bag, and you pick your apples off the tree.  They have several different varieties.  In the barn, they have cider, doughnuts, pies, jams, and other items.  All fairly priced, I think (at least, compared to other orchards we've been to), and, again, not too flashy.\n\nDon't get the wrong idea about there being a lack of entertainment: this place is perfect for kids, too!  They don't need to be overstimulated by displays and sugar.  Here they can pick their own pumpkin and tote in in a Radio Flyer to the pumpkin wash (to clean off the dirt n mud).\n\nIt might be a bit of a drive for some, but it's well worth it.  Make a day out of it, if you can - after this visit, head a little further into Union to visit the Illinois Railway Museum!",

            "description": "We drove here from Chicago with our 5 month old son.  I was intent on apple picking and getting pumpkins not at the local Jewel, but also not dealing with outrageous fees and huge crowds.  This little orchard was just the ticket.\n\nWe strolled around in the orchard and picked a peck which I think came out to like $12.  It was gorgeous, and there were still plenty of apples left, although my husband is freakishly tall so we were able to reach up for the good apples all those average size people left behind. Lots of families but not too crowded.  We sampled our loot while walking around which was cool.\n\nAfter we got our fill of apples, we got 2 pumpkins and bought a bunch of stuff in the shop including salsas, apple butter, cider, doughnuts, a bunch of other jars of stuff that looked tasty.  The damage?  $95.  We realized we'd been had when on the way home we passed a pumpkin patch that said \"2 pumpkins for $3\" (We paid $9 a piece for ours).  However, there was no entrance fee and no parking fee, and the people running this joint were really nice.  Definitely recommended for a day out of the city.\n\nIf picking apples and buying canned goods sounds too boring, All Seasons Orchard is nearby, but it looked massively crowded so we stayed clear.",
