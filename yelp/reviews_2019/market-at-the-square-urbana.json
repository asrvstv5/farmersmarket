            "description": "You can find me at the Urbana Farmer's Market every Saturday! I LOVE it! Here's some tips....\n\nToo expensive?\nThis market is one of those markets where the vendor has to grow or make what it's selling. That means that things are higher quality than other markets where a lot of vendors buy fruit and vegetables in bulk from distributors and resell it. Want to save money? Check out the \"seconds\" bins underneath the table tops. This is where you can get produce like tomatoes for sometimes half the price!\n\nToo crowded?\nSHOW UP EARLY! The retired folks do it right. Get there before 9am, and you'll avoid the strollers and impatient crowds.\n\nNot finding what you're looking for?\nThis goes back to the fact that the vendor has to grow what it sells. Obviously, you're probably not going to find cucumbers in August. They just don't typically grow around that time around here. Although, it all depends on the year. A warm spring means you might find tomatoes as early as May. A cool summer means you might find cucumbers in August. Also, SHOW UP EARLY! The good stuff always goes fast!",

            "description": "The farmer's market is one of my favorite things to do every Saturday! I just feel happy starting my weekend at the market - browsing, shopping, enjoying the activity, talking to people I see week after week, and getting a little breakfast. People and the whole vibe is so friendly.\n\nThough you might consider things a bit more pricey than what you'd find at a store, keep in mind that this is locally produced by people who work hard to make artisan products and grow/raise organic food. I appreciate this so much since I have a \"black thumb\" and can't grow much of anything. The in-season product is so good. Asparagus and scapes in the spring. I brave the heat for the corn, peaches, and tomatoes that are their best mid-summer. The kale, squash, potatoes in the fall. Offerings throughout the season include baked goods, jams, handcrafts, jewelry, soaps and salves.\n\nThere's plenty of free parking for both cars and bikes. It's easy access. Bring sunscreen if you're going to hang and bring your own shopping bags if you can. There's all sorts of music going on. And sometimes there are special programs - like local bands, grilled pizza tutorials, bike clinics (where you can get a free tune up!), blood drives if you're able to donate, etc.\n\nBonus: Due to my weekend habit at this farmer's market, I smell and look amazing because I've gotten so much handmade soap and jewelry from vendors here. I go hungry but leave happy - partly because I really enjoy the breakfast burritos, donuts, kettle corn...",

It's good for my soul.\n\nLast year we loved getting donuts from Pandamonium and goodies from Hopscotch. Hopscotch isn't at the market this year but you can still get Kaya's goodies at Art Mart on Prospect.\n\nToday we purchased some sweet corn, tomatoes, onions, arugula and kale. All of these items were grown in the CU area. True, you may pay a bit more than at Wal-Mart or Meijer but you are supporting your neighbors rather than a large corporation.\n\nPlus, everything is so tasty.

Tomatoes are also priced at $3.00 a pound even when the vendors' tables groan with them in August. New York's Union Square greenmarket is cheaper! Of course there's that airfare...\n\nI go once in a while to buy zucchini, onions, and garlic and to get tomatoes from vendors who sell the ones with blemishes for $2.00 a pound or less. If you poke around you can find some bargains, but this is the most expensive farmers market I've ever been to unfortunately.",

Why would I pay more for local crops in Champaign than irrigated stuff driven more than an hour in to LA?\n\nBlah.\n\nAside from that, this is actually a pretty great farmers market.  Big (bigger than most where I live, though we have multiple throughout the city every day of the week, so I suppose that's why) and with a great selection.  We bought two dozen tuberose that made the house smell like Hawaii for days, fantastic sweet potatoes and the obligatory crate of sweet corn.  The ice cream truck sold us a pint of lemon that was, dare I say, BETTER THAN CUSTARD CUP.\n\nIt's always a must whenever I visit Champaign-Urbana, and rarely disappoints.",

Second, when I go there, I make it a goal to buy at least one vegetable to incorporate into my cooking. This week I am going to bake some zucchini. Mmm...\n\nSome of my favorite items here:\nPumpkins. I bought a pumpkin with some serious \"personality\" for $5. It was tri-colored and oddly shaped. It makes for a great doorstep decoration.\n\nApple butter and pumpkin butter from the amish stand. Delicious and only made with natural ingredients.\n\nFresh herbs like basil, except they go bad if you don't use them immediately.\n\nCherry tomatoes, especially the heirloom variety that come in unusual colors. I had the privilege of trying a purple - yes, purple - variety that was savory. Mmm...\n\nAdditional favorites: \n- Live folk and clarinet music\n- Fresh kettle corn\n- The waffle truck!

Music is a mixed bag to put it nicely. Great place for kids to practice their violin lessons and make some good money. The arts and crafts vendors tend to have marketable but highly predictable, tame and cliched work. Yet many people think it's fine art. That being said, there are a few surprises worth noting, mainly in specialty food products. But honestly, it's not stuff that you can only get there. Also the crowds and parking is a drag.

I like the influx of the food trucks, but Fryer Tucks was first and I  find myself falling back to wanting a egg, cheese, and sausage on a wheat english muffin with onions.  They use eggs and sausage from the local vendors.  I think Cracked might also use local eggs, but not sure.  \nThere are your mainstay vendors, but every year there is some turn over with new farmers or artisans that help to make every year a little different.\nThe live music provided by good and not so good musicians also lends to the character of the market.  It is also nice to peruse the various community groups whom are out there.  Art mart, Lincoln Square Mall, Common Ground Co-op and downtown Urbana are all right there also.\nSeveral veggie vendors have seconds available to help save a few $ as the market is not as cheap as the grocery store.  Garlic in particular seems $$ to me, but the varieties have been fun to explore and I hear tell its not as easy to grow and prep for  market as onions.\nI will also be quite honest it's not just about the food and crafts.  For me the market is very much part of my social life.  I see so many people I know there every Saturday morning from co-workers, to neighbors, to random friends I have not seen in months. I've made friends with many of the vendors and look forward to talking to them about their grandkids, their hogs not liking the left over broccoli, growing conditions, recipes, and food policy.  The community I have found on the corner of Illinois and Vine is lively, generally friendly, and safe.",

I can say that when I suggest a trip to the farmer's market, this is the only one I think of.  I once went to another one in Champaign.  It was three pick-up trucks in a parking lot. \n\nThis is slightly better.  There are more vendors, but I wouldn't call it \"large\".  There are enough vendors selling vegetables that it is in your benefit to walk around first and compare prices and freshness.  Although, if you can suggest that people walk around the whole market before purchasing vegetables that pretty much makes it hard to argue that the market is \"large\".\n\nInitially my husband and I went to this market just to get fresh vegetables that we could not grow ourselves (green beans, peaches).  Over time we have branched out and tried some of the other products such as the cheeses and baked products.  We have always been pleased with our purchases.\n\nIf you go here with the intention to buy all your groceries for the week, you will probably be hungry by Tuesday.

Market at the Square is probably at the top of that list.\n\nThe market is an abundance of local and organic produce, meats, and baked goods.  There are artisan goat cheeses from a local farm, lots of grass feed meat and poultry, and all sorts of goodies baked by small home bakers and Amish families from the communities south of here.  There are all sorts of unique arts and crafts that make the Market a great place to go if you need to get a special gift for someone difficult to buy for.  There's a wonderful upbeat vibe that is largely due to a delightful one man band who has turned singing the alphabet into an art form.  And let's not forget the kettle corn!\n\nI would recommend getting to the Market as early as possible so as not to miss out on anything.  I've had some very sad mornings where I've succumbed to the snooze alarm and just missed getting the last quart of plump, sweet-smelling berries.  Don't let this happen to you! Get to the market by 8:30 or 9:00 and you'll be treated to a wide selection of whatever local produce happens to be ripe and a variety of other wonderful items.  Be sure to bring cash, as some vendors don't accept checks or credit cards.\n\nOne word of warning:  There are a lot of political and religious organizations with booths along the north edge of the Market, where you will likely be approached to sign a petition, offered flyers, and the like.  Generally, no one is too pushy and a polite \"no thank you\" is all it will take if you don't wish to partake.  Be particularly wary of the guy offering free stress tests; He's a scientology recruiter.",

            "description": "It says something good about what people like that the farmer's market flourishes alongside the derelict Lincoln Square Mall. I look forward to coming here early every Saturday morning for produce, artisan breads, and other assorted surprises. \n\nWhatever fruits and vegetables that are in season can be found here and some of them are surprising- gooseberries, currants, kohlrabi, rainbow kale, and more. A wide variety of animal products can also be found: from buffalo meat to honey to farm-fresh eggs. It's not always expensive either- my kohlrabi was a mere 75 cents and a bundle of arugala can be had for a dollar. \n\nThere are random stalls that sell assorted prepared foods, such as artisan bread and kettle corn. Recently the Papa George Greek food truck Justine mentioned has been popular. I love their creamy hummus and sweet baklava. I also saw a new smoothie stand this Saturday.\n\nThe Farmer's Market, when it is open, is the best place to buy produce. It's fresher and you can converse with the farmer's to learn about local food. Come early for the best selection and bring cash!",

            "description": "Every May I look forward to going to the Farmers' Market in at the Lincoln Square mall.  They have fresh produce and meats from local growers and some other prepared foods (pies!).  It's a very friendly atmosphere and it doesn't have the redundancy (Soulard in St. Louis) or pretentiousness (Clayton, MO) that other farmers markets may have.\n\nSadly, two of the stands I used to frequent the most are now gone.  I have not seen the \"russian lady\" with her pirozkis and crepes, nor have I seen the pies I've grown accustomed to expecting.  Alas.  (If anyone knows what's happened to them, let me know)\n\nI haven't seen any produce that I can't possibly find anywhere else (like 8 different types of nectarines at some SF farmers markets), but give it a try and I assure you that you'll find something there that'll bring you back the next week.",

The people were nice, there is plenty of parking, lots of food to choose from, and other vendors like soap, candles, wood-working, and the awesome t-shirt lady who makes her own designs.  Seriously, go check her booth out.\n\nOnce you go, you'll be hooked.",

            "description": "I biked over to the Market for the first time last weekend, and am definitely going to be back every weekend.  The fruits and veggies are very affordable, not too much more than prices at Meijer's and with much higher quality.  The meat and cheese is more limited and a little pricier, but also delicious.  I ended up buying peppers, sweet corn, apples, zucchini, and squash, all of which were phenomenal.  There's also super cheap and delicious kettle corn, which I'd recommend picking up for $3 for a very decent sized bag.  You can also get all sorts of fantastic breads, baked goods, brittle, salsa, and plenty of free samples!  It's certainly worth getting up early and checking out.  My only regret is that it doesn't stay open later in the afternoon.",

            "description": "Birkenstocks with socks, straw hats, cargo shorts, flouncy skirts, \"Green\" bags: I must be at Market at the Square, a favorite stop for the artsy folk.  This is a great place for people watchers, too.  Arts and crafts of questionable value and aesthetics, musicians of arguable talent add to the picture.  There are lots of pretty flowers and some early season herbs and vegetables that will improve as the season progresses.  As farmer's markets go, this is nothing special, but it is local and, as the weeks pass, the selections of produce can reach impressive.  Definitely walk around before buying as the prices may differ, as well as the quality.  My favorite part of the scene is when there is a tent for rescue dogs.  Over time, there have been Saint Bernards, Greyhounds, Rottweilers, to name a few.  Always such sweet beings with sad stories.  Take one less basil plant and give that money to the rescue.  A sad part of the market is its proximity to the Lincoln Square Mall, considered by some as the saddest mall in America.  But that's another review entirely.",

            "description": "my saturday mornings are now dictated by the market, i plan around it so i don't miss the chance to stock up on freshly made goat cheese from prairie farms, heirloom tomatoes from blue moon, freshly washed and picked salad greens, new potatoes, corn, apples and peaches!  the prices are admittedly a bit high, but i'd personally rather pay for the fresh locally grown produce than the overpriced shipped from CA veggies at schnucks.  i always round off my mornings with a stop into artmart for their cheese and chocolate tastings...its just another lovely urbana ritual that really makes me miss home less.  my homesickness will blossom exponentially come november 8, whatever will i do without you market on the square?",
